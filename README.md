## Windows Subsystem for Linux WebSocket crash demo

Demonstrates how [PhantomJS][phantom] 2.1.1 crashes when loading pages
containing [WebSockets][ws] while running under [Windows Subsystem for Linux
from the Windows 10 Creators Update][wsl] (version 1703, OS build 15063.332).
This appears germane to [Microsoft/BashOnWindows#903][#903].

[phantom]: http://phantomjs.org/
[ws]:      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API
[wsl]:     https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/04/11/windows-10-creators-update-whats-new-in-bashwsl-windows-console/
[#903]:    https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/903

The `./run-demo` script installs PhantomJS 2.1.1 via the [phantomjs-prebuilt][]
npm package, and uses the [live-server][] package to serve `index.html` and
reproduce the crash, since it injects JavaScript code for signalling a reload
via a WebSocket; this appears to be a similar mechanism to that used by
[Karma][].

[phantomjs-prebuilt]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs-prebuilt
[live-server]:        https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server
[Karma]:              https://karma-runner.github.io/

The first example demonstrates a successful run on an installation of Ubuntu
17.04 running under VMware Fusion 8.5.7, as well as a native installation of
macOS 10.12.5, both running [Node.js][] v7.10.0 installed via [nvm][]:

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[nvm]:     https://github.com/creationix/nvm

```
$ ./run-demo

Serving "." at http://127.0.0.1:8080

        // <![CDATA[  <-- For SVG support
        if ('WebSocket' in window) {

        // ...snip...
</script>
```

The second example is from the Windows Subsystem for Linux as described in
the opening paragraph, also running under VMware Fusion 8.5.7 using Node.js
v7.10.0 installed via nvm:

```
$ ./run-demo

./run-demo: line 112: 20226 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) "${PHANTOMJS_CMD[@]}"
```

To demonstrate the difference to loading the page without WebSocket code,
`./run-demo --no-ws` uses the [http-server][] package to successfully serve the
`index.html` file without a crash. The output is roughly the same across all
platforms:

[http-server]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

```
$ ./run-demo --no-ws

### Debug and `strace` output

The `./run-demo` script also takes one of two optional flags, `--debug` or
`--strace`, to run `phantomjs --debug` and `strace phantomjs`, respectively.

The `logs/` directory contains `./run-demo --debug` and `./run-demo --strace`
output, both with and without WebSockets (`--no-ws`), on both native Ubuntu
Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux. The files were generated all at once by
running `./collect-logs`.

The `strace phantomjs` logs checked into the repo are heavily filtered by the
`STRACE_FILTER` defined in `collect-logs`, and have had all lines removed just
before the point at which the `index.html` file is successfully loaded (for
`--no-ws`) or at which the crash occurs. The relevant output from
`logs/wsl/strace.log` appears to be:

```
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM|SOCK_CLOEXEC|SOCK_NONBLOCK, IPPROTO_IP) = 8
setsockopt(8, SOL_SOCKET, SO_OOBINLINE, [1], 4) = 0
connect(8, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(8080), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
getsockname(8, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(58904), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, [16]) = 0
getpeername(8, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(8080), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, [16]) = 0
getsockopt(8, SOL_SOCKET, SO_TYPE, [1], [4]) = 0
--- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_addr=0x500000022} ---

) = 127
tgkill(22020, 22020, SIGSEGV)           = 0
--- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SI_TKILL, si_pid=22020, si_uid=1000} ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV (core dumped) +++
.../wsl-websocket-crash-demo/run-demo: line 78: 22018 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) "${PHANTOMJS_CMD[@]}"
```

whereas `logs/wsl/strace-no-websocket.log` shows:

```
pselect6(4, [3], [], [], {0, 0}, {NULL, 8}) = 1 (in [3], left {0, 0})
read(3, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)          = 8
write(3, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)         = 8
write(1, "STATUS: success\n", 16STATUS: success
)       = 16
write(1, "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>\n  </"..., 66<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>
  </head>
  <body>
  

</body></html>
) = 66
```

You can edit and re-run `collect-logs` or run `./run-demo --strace` directly to
generate the complete strace output.
